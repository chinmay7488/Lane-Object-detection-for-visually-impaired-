# Lane-Object-detection-for-visually-impaired-
<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

This is the report document for “Lane and Object Detection for Visually Impaired”.
Lane detection is an application of environmental perception, which aims to detect lane areas or lane lines by camera. Lane detection is a challenging problem. Lane detection is a multifeatured detection problem that has become a real challenge for computer vision and machine learning techniques. We will build a machine learning project to detect lane. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using OpenCV library.
Object detection is one of the most basic and central task in computer vision. Its task is to find all the interested objects in the image and video, and determine the category and location of the objects. Object detection is widely used and has strong practical value and research prospects. Applications include face detection, pedestrian detection and vehicle detection. For object detection we use Yolo algorithm.
Agile Process is used as the methodology.
Coding is going to be handle by Python, an object-oriented approach. And the Database system is to be created using MYSQL.

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

For a visually impaired person, how can we build something to help navigate the road better?
Visually impaired individuals will face many difficulties and one of the common difficulties is when they involve in self-navigating at an environment which is strange for them. In fact, physical movement is one of the biggest challenges for them. Besides that, while they travel around or walking at a crowded Lane, it may pose great difficulty.


<h3>Objective of Project</h3>

Our objective was to build something to help visually impaired persons to navigate the road better. Our task consists of two problems :
1. Direction/ Lane Detections
2. Object detections for incoming obstructions/vehicles/people
3. Location and time interval store in database
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Visually impaired individuals will face many difficulties and one of the common difficulties is when they involve in self-navigating at an environment which is strange for them. In fact, physical movement is one of the biggest challenges for them. Besides that, while they travel around or walking at a crowded Lane, it may pose great difficulty. We propose a software that predicts the walking lane and the software can detect the objects in the user's surroundings. It can alert the user of the obstacles in his/her pathway.
